If the SI unit value it displays in its own plug-ins and log files makes sense to you, then the issue is probably with the multiplier, divider or offset, or all of them used to convert it (see above sections about the customization). The floating point data which is coming from Signal K server node is given as such to DashT EngineDJG instrument, but as a string (we are talking to a JavaScript program) in scientific notation with single decimal format. For example, if DashT receives 0.24444444, it will be given as \"24.5E-2\" to EngineDJG instrument. General rule is that values with too many zeros are not advisable in JavaScript. Avoid calculations where any result, including intermediate values would lead to values like 0.0000003."
