    "The requirement to be able to show engine and energy system data on Dash came first into mind where a browser techniques could be useful and fast (or slow) enough for that type of data. The usage of web techniques would allow to jail break from wxWidget's bit aging GUI and move to the other end of the GUI development paradigm, _i.e._ no limits! After short R&D prototyping and proof-of-concept the limitations of the run-time environment became known as well as the potential communication issues. Robustness and simplicity was put in front and a bit old fashioned web techniques were used because of the simple fact that the wxWebView itself and the back-ends it is using are not necessarily even from this decade!"

In order to avoid multitude of network connections, DashT's Signal K streamer was chosen to feed the instruments by subscription and by a C++ call-back function. That is definitely a modern touch while it allows both to limit number of network connections towards the Signal K server node (which has certainly no problem to deal with those even if that would have been the case, it looks to me) and to continue to feed Tactics derived active calculations instruments from the same source of data."
